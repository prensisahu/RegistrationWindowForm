# Windows Forms Registration & Login System

## Overview
This is a simple **Windows Forms Application** built using C# that provides a **User Registration and Login System**. The application allows users to **register** with their **mobile number, full name, and password**. After registration, users can log in using their **email and password**. If the login credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed.

## Features
- **User Registration:**
  - Users need to enter **mobile number, full name, and password** to register.
  - After successful registration, the user can proceed to login.

- **User Login:**
  - Users must enter the **correct email and password** to log in.
  - If incorrect details are entered, an **error message** is shown.

- **Forgot Password:**
  - A **"Forgot Password"** option is available below the login form.
  - Clicking on it opens a **new page for password recovery** (Feature not yet implemented).
  - SMS-based password reset requires a **paid Twilio service**.
